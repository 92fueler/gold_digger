    <h1>Mom's Awesome Spaghetti</h1>
    <p>My mom would make spaghetti for dinner a lot when I was a kid. It wasn't until I was an adult and had moved out of the house that I realized how comforting and delicious her recipe is! When I visit her now I always ask her to make it for me for dinner.</p>
